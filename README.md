# VSD
 **VSD (VLSI System Design) is an open-source platform and training initiative that focuses on:**
* Hands-on learning of VLSI design flow RTL2GDS.
* Using open-source EDA tools for chip design and verification.
* Working on RISC-V based projects and SoC design.
* Encouraging students and engineers to build skills through hackathons, workshops, and open challenges.

# OBJECTIVE
This repo documents my journey in **India‚Äôs RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, organized by **IIT Gandhinagar** and **VLSI System Design (VSD)**.

# Vision
To gain **hands-on experience in chip design** and contribute towards **India‚Äôs semiconductor self-reliance**, supporting the vision of *‚ÄúOne Tapeout Per Student‚Äù*.

# Prerequisites
1. Ubuntu 20.04 or later (Linux environment recommended).
2. Do not open or mount the Ubuntu ISO manually - it's only needed during OS installation.
3. Use the terminal inside your installed Ubuntu system for all steps below.

# Environment Setup Instructions
## step 1: Download Required Software
Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Desktop)
üîó[Download ISO (64-bit)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso)
Oracle VirtualBox (for running Ubuntu VM)
üîó[Download VirtualBox for Windows](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## step 2: Create a Virtual Machine in VirtualBox
After creating the VM, load the downloaded Ubuntu ISO as a startup disk and install Ubuntu normally inside the VM.

## step 3: System Requirements
* 6GB RAM, 50 GB HDD 
* Ubuntu 20.04+ 
* 4vCPU
